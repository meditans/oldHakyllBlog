** TODO Create a cabal/stack structure
Which includes both the hakyll and the clay aspect, so that basically when the
site is recompiled the css is also rewritten.

** TODO Adjust the zoom issue
I want a smooth zoom experience. I could take some ideas from Oliver Charles' blog.

I want to be able to mark some articles as stub. They shouldn't be deployed to
the site, but I should be able to see them offline.

** TODO Infrastructure for math rendering
I should be able to set up some latex rendering.

** TODO Check the font deployment
I should check that the fonts are correctly visualized in other computers.

I should check the compatibility of this site for mobile devices.

** TODO Finish the lens series of posts

I need this tool for generating zeal documentation from a stack directory.

** TODO Remove old blogposts

** TODO Clear the css situation

** TODO How do I link to internal =.org= files?

When the code lines are too wide, they overflow from the little nice box.
