** DONE Create a cabal/stack structure {#h4}
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 01:05]
There are two executables in the cabal project now: `site`, which is the Hakyll
program, and `css`, which generates the css with Clay.
** DONE Adjust the zoom issue
CLOSED: [2016-02-04 Thu 16:18]
I want a smooth zoom experience. I could take some ideas from Oliver Charles' blog.
For now, I'm ok with how the zoom issue is handled by tufte.css. Closing.
** DONE Create the structure for stub articles
CLOSED: [2016-02-05 Fri 17:47]
I want to be able to mark some articles as stub. They shouldn't be deployed to
the site, but I should be able to see them offline. Check out
http://geekplace.eu/flow/posts/2014-09-24-draft-posts-with-hakyll.html

Various possibilities:
- [[http://www.blaenkdenum.com/posts/drafts-in-hakyll/][blaenkdenum]] suggests applying a prefilter to take the command preview. The
  upside is that it seems little code is needed.
- [[http://geekplace.eu/flow/posts/2014-09-24-draft-posts-with-hakyll.html][flow]] suggests to put drafts in a draft folder, and then proposes a little bash
  script to publish them.
- [[https://github.com/limansky/limansky_me/blob/master/posts/2015-10-31-Draft-posts-with-Hakyll.md][limansky]] suggests to put drafts in a draft folder, and evoke it with a command
  line option. There is some cruft involved.
- [[http://jdreaver.com/posts/2014-06-22-math-programming-blog-hakyll.html][jdreaver]] suggests a very short method, which involves modifying the
  postPattern

This last jdreaver suggestion was what I implemented in the end.

** TODO Remove the date from the articles
Let's just use chris done's site as a template for this. Did he blog about that?
** DONE Infrastructure for math rendering
CLOSED: [2016-02-03 Wed 23:38]
I should be able to set up some latex rendering. Like in $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$
** DONE Check the font deployment
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 01:07]
Fonts are now correctly deployed. Maybe in the future I could think about making
an image for the header, without sending the font.
** DONE Mobile version deployment
CLOSED: [2016-02-04 Thu 16:11]
I should check the compatibility of this site for mobile devices. This should be
handled by tufte.css; I can check later but I close this issue for now.

** DONE Remove old blogposts
CLOSED: [2016-02-03 Wed 16:27]
** DONE Clear the css situation
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 01:08]
The css files are now automatically generated thanks to the `css` executable.

Checking that links are ok?
The answer is here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hakyll/XbB20ak441Q

** DONE I should fix the code overflow
CLOSED: [2016-02-04 Thu 16:11]
When the code lines are too wide, they overflow from the little nice box.
This has been fixed.

** TODO I should fontify the haskell code
Like,for example, put a gracious symbol instead of ->.
