** DONE Create a cabal/stack structure
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 01:05]
There are two executables in the cabal project now: `site`, which is the Hakyll
program, and `css`, which generates the css with Clay.
** TODO Adjust the zoom issue
I want a smooth zoom experience. I could take some ideas from Oliver Charles' blog.

** TODO Create the structure for stub articles
I want to be able to mark some articles as stub. They shouldn't be deployed to
the site, but I should be able to see them offline.

** TODO Infrastructure for math rendering
I should be able to set up some latex rendering.

** DONE Check the font deployment
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 01:07]
Fonts are now correctly deployed. Maybe in the future I could think about making
an image for the header, without sending the font.

I should check the compatibility of this site for mobile devices.

CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 01:08]
The css files are now automatically generated thanks to the `css` executable.
