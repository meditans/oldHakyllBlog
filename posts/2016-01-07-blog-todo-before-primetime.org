title: Blog todo list, before primetime

** DONE Create a cabal/stack structure {#h4}
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 01:05]
There are two executables in the cabal project now: `site`, which is the Hakyll
program, and `css`, which generates the css with Clay.
** TODO Adjust the zoom issue
I want a smooth zoom experience. I could take some ideas from Oliver Charles' blog.

** TODO Create the structure for stub articles
I want to be able to mark some articles as stub. They shouldn't be deployed to
the site, but I should be able to see them offline.
Check out http://geekplace.eu/flow/posts/2014-09-24-draft-posts-with-hakyll.html
** TODO Remove the date from the articles
Let's just use chris done's site as a template for this. Did he blog about that?
** DONE Infrastructure for math rendering
CLOSED: [2016-02-03 Wed 23:38]
I should be able to set up some latex rendering. Like in $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$
** DONE Check the font deployment
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 01:07]
Fonts are now correctly deployed. Maybe in the future I could think about making
an image for the header, without sending the font.

I should check the compatibility of this site for mobile devices.
